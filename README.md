# GraphX-Rendering-Engine
A 3D real time rendering engine (including support for 2D) developed using OpenGL and C++

GraphX Rendering Engine is a Final year Computer Science Project which features a real time rendering engine for rendering 2D as well as 3D objects and also includes a fully featured Graphics Mathematics Library which handles all the 3D maths components required by the engine.

Note: After building the project, copy the 'assimp-vc140-mt.dll' file from the folder 'Dependencies/Assimp/lib/' into the folder 'bin/Win32/Debug/'
